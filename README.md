## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Run the LeetCodeAutomater

 **1. Download the Chrome extension**

There are **two options**:
- **Option 1:** Download directly from the release page

    [üëâ LeetCode Token Viewer (Download Link)](https://github.com/Omkumar2003/LeetcodeAutomater/releases/download/1.04/LeetCode-Token-Viewer.zip)

    and **Extract** the zip File
    
- **Option 2:** Clone the GitHub repository:
    
    
    git clone https://github.com/Omkumar2003/LeetcodeAutomater.git
    
    Inside the repo, find the folder named LeetCode Token Viewer

**2. Load the Extension in Chrome**

- Open Chrome and go to: chrome://extensions

- Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle at top-right)

- Click **Load unpacked**

- Select the folder LeetCode Token Viewer

**3. Run the Program**

You can run it in **two ways**:

- **Option 1:** Run the executable

    [üíª LeetcodeAutomater.exe (Download)](https://github.com/Omkumar2003/LeetcodeAutomater/releases/download/1.04/LeetcodeAutomater.exe)

- **Option 2:** Run from source

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Omkumar2003/LeetcodeAutomater.git
    cd LeetcodeAutomater
    node ok.js
    ```


**4. Get & Use Your Merge Token**

When you run the program, it will prompt for your Merge Token.
- Make sure you‚Äôre **logged into LeetCode** in your browser.
- Open the **Chrome Extension** ‚Üí click *Copy Merge Token.
- **Paste** the token into the program when prompted.

## ‚öô Executable(.exe) ‚Äî LeetCode Automater

The LeetCode Automater executable automates the process of submitting your solutions to LeetCode, powered by the Merge Token you fetch with the Chrome Extension.

## üõ† How to Build the Executable(.exe) (Optional)

If you'd prefer to build the executable manually:

```
npm install -g pkg
pkg ok.js --targets node18-win-x64  --output LeetcodeAutomater.exe
```

This is how the provided executable [LeetcodeAutomater.exe](https://github.com/Omkumar2003/LeetcodeAutomater/releases/download/1.04/LeetcodeAutomater.exe)¬†was¬†created.


## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**Issue 1: Extension not loading in Chrome**
- Make sure Developer Mode is enabled in `chrome://extensions`
- Check if you selected the correct folder (LeetCode-Token-Viewer)
- Try reloading the extension

**Issue 2: "Merge Token not found" error**
- Ensure you're logged into LeetCode in your browser
- Open the Chrome Extension and click "Copy Merge Token"
- The token is only valid while you're logged in

**Issue 3: Node.js errors when running from source**
- Make sure you have Node.js v14 or higher installed
- Run `npm install -g pkg` before building
- Check that all dependencies are installed

**Issue 4: Executable not working**
- Make sure you've extracted the zip file completely
- On Mac/Linux, you may need to give execution permission: `chmod +x LeetcodeAutomater.exe`
- Try running from source instead (Option 2)
